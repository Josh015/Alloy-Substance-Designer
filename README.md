# Alloy Substance Designer Shaders
Alloy's preview shaders designed to work with Allegorithmic's Substance Designer tool to provide a mostly accurate preview of how the resulting material set will look in Unity using Alloy. This code is provided AS IS with no support guarantees beyond attempting to keep pace with new Substance Designer releases. 

### Usage
1. Clone this repo into a local directory.
2. Open Substance Designer and either create or open a project.
3. In the "3D View" sub-window, select "Materials/Default/Shader/Load...".
4. In the load dialog, navigate to the cloned folder with the alloy preview shaders, and select the "alloy.glslfx" file.
5. In the "Explorer" sub-window, click and drag your substance from the project tree and drop it on the scene in the "3D View" sub-window to refresh the values for the shader.
