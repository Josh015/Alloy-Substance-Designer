Alloy has a preview shader designed to work with Allegorithmic's Substance Designer tool to provide a mostly accurate preview of how the resulting material set will look in Unity 5 using Alloy.

### Usage

1. Clone this repo into a local directory.
2. Open Substance Designer and either create or open a project.
3. In the "3D View" sub-window, select "Materials/Default/Shader/Load...".
4. In the load dialog, navigate to the cloned folder with the alloy preview shaders, and select the "*.glslfx" file for whichever shader you wish to load.
5. In the "Explorer" sub-window, click and drag your substance from the project tree and drop it on the scene in the "3D View" sub-window to refresh the values for the shader.
